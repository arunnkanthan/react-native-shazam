## Tutorial
Setting up dev environment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc
- android studio: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/

## Notes/Thoughts
- React Native CLI vs Expo CLI
- android or apple emulator need to be up and running before i run the app/expo
- in mac (cmd - m) reload the device expo emulator if changes havent reloaded from the code editor
- rewatch: Debugging in VSCode, Publishing
    Publishing through expo is a great way to test the app in the field without pushing to the App/Play store
